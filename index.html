          Watch this video to understand the essence of self-regulation.
          <br /> The Marshmallow test predicts whether a child will have a happy
          life or not. Children are given a marshmallow. They are told that if
          they don't eat it, they will be given another one. All they have to do
          is wait fifteen minuted. Longitudinal studies have proven that
          children who were able to control themselves and not eat the
          marshmallow, had less risks of dropping out of high-school or college,
          less divorce rates, less addiction problems. They had more control of
          their lives and therefore enjoyed a happier life.

          After watching the video, think about:
          <ul>
            What kind of child are you? What kind of adult do you want to be?
            What do you have to do to get there?
          </ul>
